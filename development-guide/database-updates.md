# Updates to the database

After verification data is returned, the database is updated to track whether a user is reachable, and commit any updates to their address that were returned by the verification.

## Overview

Verification data is returned with various codes that indicate whether a user has changed their address through the postal system, or the address is no longer valid for that person.  For more information, many companies that perform address verification have posted helpful articles online, and can be found with an internet search like, "How to decipher NCOA address verification codes."
